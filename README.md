# attribute-filtering

Application that allows the computation of attribute filters from mathematical morphology. It is possible to use different attributes (and add new ones) and filtering rules, use Max-Tree hierarchical structure or Dual-Input Max-Tree structure. 

### Example output
Image from astronomy, removing intrestellar noise - on the left original image, on the right filtered image. Filtration was performed by hyperconnected attribute filter with attribute size.
